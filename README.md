Elm Runner
==========

A small game written in the [Elm Programming Language](http://elm-lang.org) as a homework for the Seminar in Advanced Functional Programming held at University of Wroc≈Çaw in 2015.

You can play it right away in your browser [here](http://mkacz91.github.io/elm-runner).

Or you can build it yourself, using the provided `Makefile` and then open `index.html` in your browser. I used Elm 0.15.0 and the 2.0.1 version of the `elm-lang/core` library when writing this.
